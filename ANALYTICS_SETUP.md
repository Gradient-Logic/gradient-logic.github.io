# 📊 Google Analytics 4 Setup Guide

Your site now has Google Analytics 4 tracking ready to go! Follow these simple steps:

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your GA4 Measurement ID

1. Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **"Start measuring"** (if new) or **"Admin"** (if existing)
4. Create a new property:
   - Property name: `Gradient Logic Website`
   - Country: Your country
   - Currency: Your currency
5. Click **"Create"** and accept terms
6. Choose **"Web"** platform
7. Set up data stream:
   - Website URL: `https://gradient-logic.github.io`
   - Stream name: `Gradient Logic`
8. **Copy your Measurement ID** (looks like `G-ABC123DEF4`)

### Step 2: Add Your Measurement ID ✅ DONE!

Your Measurement ID `G-MQTH1GW250` is already configured in the code! 

**Optional:** If you want to use environment variables, create `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-MQTH1GW250
```

But it will work perfectly without this file since the ID is already hardcoded.

### Step 3: Deploy

1. Build and deploy your site:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Your analytics are now live! 🎉
