## ðŸŽ¯ Advanced: Calendly + AI Voice Assistant Integration

Once you set up **Bland AI** (from previous guide):

### Workflow:
```
1. Prospect calls your AI assistant
   â†“
2. AI qualifies them, answers basic questions
   â†“
3. If qualified: AI offers to book a call
   â†“
4. AI sends them your Calendly link via SMS
   â†“
5. Prospect books directly
   â†“
6. You get calendar invite + their pre-call answers
```

### How to Connect (Bland AI + Calendly):

**In your Bland AI prompt, add:**
```
If the caller wants to schedule a demo or speaks with a human:

Say: "I can book a time for you to speak with our founder right now. 
I'm sending you a text message with the booking link. You can pick 
any time that works for you - usually within 24-48 hours."

Then use the send_sms function with this message:
"Thanks for your interest in Gradient Logic! Book a time to chat here: 
https://calendly.com/gradient-logic/discovery-call

Looking forward to it!
- Gradient Logic Team"
```
